# Walk People

# Introduction
This app is homage to the days of the Walk-man, where people would have to play their own cassettes, instead of relying on the vast array of music 
we can literally just choose from today. 
Our project works similarly, where we allow the user to have a more unique and treasured experience with their music by allowing them to upload their 
own mp3 files, organizing them into playlists, and searching for songs by title or author.
